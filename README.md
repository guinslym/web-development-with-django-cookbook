## Review:
It's a great book to start learning django. I like the fact that it's simple and easy to learn. 

I don't need too much of a machine (environnment) knowledge. Some book uses REDIS - DOCKER - RabitMQ and pretend they are for beginners. I didn't need all thoses software for this book with the exception of one of the chapter that mention Memcached. 

This book is more like an intro that's what I like about this book. For some scripts in this book, it is better to use a Django package like Django-rosetta (model translation) or Django-extensions (Create/Modified date) but this book is dead simple it gives you a way to do it without mentionning those Django packages. 

I didn't like the fact that sometimes I wanted to do a copy-paste but the copy-paste from the PDF to my code editor doesn't indent properly the code. This book should be the first book or one of the first book to read after doing the basic Django tutorial available on the Django site. The price is 29$ which is affordable.

What I don't like is that I had to use python 2. They wrote that I could use Python 3 but from chapter 1 to 4 I got a lot of bugs. In the chapter 1 and 2 I didn't have a lot but on chapter 3 and 4 I had a lots. That why I didn't do the rest of the chapters (5-11) in Python 3. So I prefer to do everything on Python by installing Continuum Anaconda. I give this book a 4 on 5. I didn't quite like the fact that this book change so often the django version 1.8.1; 1.8.4 ... they didn't tell what was the difference between those version. For the requirements they were exact at 95% I had to change the django-mptt version.
